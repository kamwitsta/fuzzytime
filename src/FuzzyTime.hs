In this module the actual conversion from time to string happens.

There are two modes, showing the time and showing the time left till something. This is represented by the duality of both FuzzyTimeConf and FuzzyTime: ClockConf and FuzzyClock serve to show the time, while TimerConf and FuzzyTimer are used for counting down.

A FuzzyTime is created from a FuzzyTimeConf with toFuzzyTime. It is translated to a string via show.

Apart from the above, two functions are exported: isTimerZero which can be used by an interface to set off the alarm when timer reaches zero, and nextFTHour which makes sure that the clock is a circular data structure.
